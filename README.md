# Exploratory Data Analysis on Video Content and Author Status

## Project Overview
At this stage of the project, exploratory data analysis (EDA) was conducted to gain a deeper understanding of the variables. Descriptive statistics were generated to examine measures of central tendency and variability for each variable, and to identify potential issues such as missing values or extreme outliers. Visualizations were also created to assess skewness, identify outliers, and better understand the population represented in the sample data.

The EDA revealed significant right-skew in count variables and an imbalance in video view counts related to claim status.

Further investigation into claim status (opinion or claim) versus author ban status showed that videos categorized as claims are far more likely to come from banned authors. Additionally, engagement levels for these claim videos from banned authors were significantly higher, raising moral and ethical concerns regarding the potential spread of harmful content.

## Data Understanding
The analysis focused on variables including video count metrics, claim status (opinion or claim), and author ban status. The EDA highlighted skewness in count variables and imbalances in video view distributions related to claim type.

## Analysis
Relationships between claim status and author ban status were examined. The analysis revealed that claim videos are disproportionately associated with banned authors and tend to have higher engagement compared to opinion videos, raising concerns about the visibility and impact of potentially harmful content.

## Conclusion
The exploratory analysis indicates that claim videos, particularly those from banned authors, receive higher engagement and may contribute to the spread of harmful content. These findings suggest that further investigation or mitigation strategies may be necessary to address the potential ethical and moral implications of content dissemination.

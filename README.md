At this stage of the project, exploratory data analysis (EDA) was conducted to gain a deeper understanding of the variables. Descriptive statistics were generated to examine each variable's measures of central tendency and variability, and to identify any potential errors, such as missing values or extreme outliers. Additionally, visualizations were created to assess skewness, identify outliers, and better understand the population represented in the sample data.

The EDA revealed significant right-skew in the count variables and an imbalance in video view counts related to claim status.

Further investigation into claim status (opinion or claim) versus author ban status showed that videos categorized as claims are far more likely to come from banned authors. Additionally, the engagement level of these claim videos from banned authors is significantly higher, raising moral and ethical concerns. Are harmful videos, whether containing graphic content or misinformation, being spread too easily? The findings suggest this is indeed the case.
